# OPENSKY - Rescue Simulation CSBot
###### Software variants developed between 2014 and 2017 to compete in RoboCupJunior Simulation (AKA CoSpace Rescue), both in Primary and Secondary sub-leagues.

## What is all this?

- The CoSpace Robot Simulator is a virtual real/simulated bridge robotics simulation environment oriented for teaching and challenges, developed by the [Advanced Robotics & Intelligent Control Centre](http://www.robo-erectus.org/) (ARICC) of [Singapore Polytechnic](http://www.sp.edu.sg/).

- CoSpace Rescue Challenge has been introduced as an official RoboCup Junior category in 2010, and it is the only RCJ sub-league to be exclusively focused on software strategy development. You can watch [This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUlGHxyS614) to understand the rules of this team game.

- This repository contains code that I developed in a partnership with both Oswald de Andrade School (from S√£o Paulo) and Santa Bartolomea Capitanio School (from Macap√°), inside the platforms own coding environment.

*NOTE:* CS is known for incompatibilities between files and maps. There is *no* guarantee that any of this will work with any versions of it on a post-2017 format.

## Team Description Papers

A few IEEE-format archives detailing universal strategies were developed by the team members for various competition events (written in brazillian Portuguese):
